 Improvements I made responding to the Formative Feedback:

For Practical4:
In my github.io, the content of file index.md was same as rob's and I have changed the content to mine.
I'm very sorry for the mass commit messages for Week 4, and this is because I was not familiar with GitHub before. Now I commit the content of Practical4 again and make my commit message informative.

For Practical5:
For the mystery_code.py, my answer was not completely correct and I have changed my answer more concise and accurate now.
For fibonacci.py, I used the wrong name "collatz.py" before and I have changed it to the "fibonacci.py" now.
 
For Practical6:
In my pie chart, there was not a title before and I have added a specific title for the pie chart now.
